### The meaning of ESG.
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. ESG investors consider environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. They believe that companies committed to sustainability and responsible business practices are more likely to succeed long-term.

There are different ways to measure ESG performance. Common metrics include:
* Environmental metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and waste production
* Social metrics such as employee diversity, labour practices, and human rights
* [Corporate] Governance metrics include board diversity, executive compensation, and shareholder rights.

ESG investors can use these metrics to screen potential investments and weigh companies.

### Benefits of ESG investing
ESG is presumed to have significant benefits. 
* Higher returns – studies have shown that ESG-focused companies may have higher returns than non-ESG companies over the long term
* Reduced risk – ESG investing can help investors reduce risk by avoiding companies exposed to environmental, social, or governance risks
* Positive impact – ESG investing can positively impact the environment and society by supporting companies committed to sustainability and responsible business practices.

### ESG is gaining popularity
ESG investing is a growing trend. There are now many ESG investment funds and ETFs available to investors.

Investors are increasingly aware of their investments’ environmental and societal impact. A growing body of research suggests that ESG-focused companies may enjoy higher long-term returns than non-ESG companies.

As the ESG movement continues to grow, more investors will likely consider ESG factors when making investment decisions. ESG advocates believe  this is good news for the environment and society, as it will help to encourage companies to adopt more sustainable practices.

ESG funds offer a way for investors to align investments with their value set and support companies working to positively impact the environment, society, and governance.
